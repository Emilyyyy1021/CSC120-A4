- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?

Encapsulation is not as hard as I expected. If you understand what is able to be modified and what is not, encapsulation will be very easy to understand. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

The java doc was very useful while commenting out the functions and encapsulating. Trying to connect the different class is difficult, because I am still not used to it, so maybe take more time exploring the codes.
